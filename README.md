# Project Final for CS598 DL4H in Spring 2023

This repository is the official implementation of [Project Final for CS598 DL4H in Spring 2023](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/519589).


## Requirements

To install requirements execute the following at the rooot directory of this repo:

```setup
conda env create --file ML39.txt
```
The environment above contains primarily:
- Python 3.9
- nltk
- gensim
- numpy
- sklearn
- keras

The above environment works on the following operating system and hardware: osx-arm64. Users may have to rectify operating system or software incompatabilities on their end.

Note, you will also need to download the ConceptNet term vectors (English-only, `numberbatch-en-19.08.txt.gz`) from [https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet-numberbatch] and include in `\Data\english_conceptnet.txt` This is mentioned in the Jupyter Notebook, but included here as a reminder.

## Training/Evaluation

The training and evaluation of the CNN models and non-CNN models are performed in the Jupyter Notebook `confusion.ipynb`

## Results

Our model achieves performance on par with the original research (see References)
